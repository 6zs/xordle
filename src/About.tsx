        <h1>Xordle Rules!</h1>
        There are two secret words.
        <br /><b>They share no letters in common.</b>
        <br />You get {maxGuesses-1} tries to guess both words.
        <br />
        <br />You start with a clue already given. It's the same for everyone. 
        <br />The daily puzzle is often themed, but not always, and the theme is often not obvious.
        <br />
        <br />Letters in your guess are:
        <br />ðŸŸ© Green if green in either word (right letter, right spot).
        <br />ðŸŸ¨ Yellow if yellow in either word (right letter, wrong spot).
        <br />â¬› Grey if it does not appear in either word.
